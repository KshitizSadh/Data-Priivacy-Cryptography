# 🔐 Key Lifecycle & Entropy – **Made Simple**

Cryptographic security begins with **randomness**. This guide explains how cryptographic keys are generated, what entropy is, how it's collected and mixed, and how keys are managed throughout their lifecycle.

# 🔄 KEY LIFECYCLE PHASES

**1. Pre-Operational** – Key Generation & Registration
**2. Operational** – Key Use, Rotation, Storage, and Distribution
**3. Post-Operational** – Key Expiry, Archival, and Revocation
**4. End-of-Life** – Key Destruction

## 🔧 1. PRE-OPERATIONAL (Generate & Register)

### 🔑 1.1 Key Generation Starts with Randomness

Every secure cryptographic key begins with a **seed** – a string of unpredictable bits collected from various **entropy sources**.

---

### 🔄 Entropy & Seed

#### ✅ What is Entropy?

Entropy means **unpredictability** – the foundation of strong cryptographic randomness.

#### 📥 Where Entropy Comes From:

| Source               | Examples                                                                            |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **OS**               | `/dev/random`, `/dev/urandom`, `getrandom()` (Linux) / `CryptGenRandom()` (Windows) |
| **CPU Instructions** | Intel `RDRAND`, AMD `RDSEED`                                                        |
| **TPM Chips**        | TPM 2.0 `GetRandom` command                                                         |
| **External Devices** | USB TRNGs, Quantum RNGs                                                             |
| **User Activity**    | Mouse movement, keystroke timing                                                    |
| **Sensors**          | Clock jitter, thermal noise (on microcontrollers, etc.)                             |

---

### 🧪 Entropy Conditioning (Bias Removal)

Raw entropy may be **noisy or biased**. Use cryptographic hash functions (e.g., SHA-256 or SHA-3) to **mix and clean it**.

**Example:**

```text
seed = SHA-512(TRNG_output || TPM_random || /dev/random_output)
```

---

### 🧪 Entropy Quality Check

* Use **OS tools** or follow **NIST SP 800-90B** for checking:

  * Repetition Test
  * Adaptive Proportion Test

---

### 🔄 Reseeding

* Periodically collect fresh entropy and **refresh PRNG/DRBG** state.
* Prevents long-term predictability or key reuse vulnerabilities.

---

### 🧮 1.2 PRNG (Pseudorandom Number Generator)

**PRNGs** are fast, deterministic algorithms used to generate random-looking data from a **seed**.

#### 🔹 Why Use PRNGs?

* TRNGs are slow or hardware-limited
* PRNGs are scalable and efficient
* Clean entropy once → generate many keys

**Example:**

* PRNG stream → XOR with plaintext → Encrypted data (stream cipher)

---

### 🎲 1.3 TRNG (True Random Number Generator)

**TRNGs** use physical processes (like thermal or quantum noise) for real randomness.

* Examples: Atmospheric noise, radioactive decay, clock drift
* Used for initial seeding of PRNGs or key generation in secure environments

### 🧱 1.4 Key Generation Best Practices

| Area                   | Best Practice                                               | Why It Matters                   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Entropy Validation** | Use quality sources (TRNG, OS) and validate with NIST tests | Poor entropy = weak keys         |
| **Key Size**           | Use recommended sizes (AES: 256-bit, RSA: 2048+ bits)       | Balance between speed & security |
| **Derive Keys**        | Use HKDF, PBKDF2 for session keys                           | Prevents key reuse               |
| **Algorithm Choice**   | AES-256, FIPS-approved ciphers                              | Ensures standard compliance      |
| **Key Uniqueness**     | Prevent duplicate keys                                      | Stops reuse & collisions         |
| **Secure Generation**  | Use HSMs or TPMs                                            | Prevent key exposure             |
| **Metadata Tags**      | Label keys (e.g., FIPS, GDPR)                               | Helps track policy compliance    |
| **Audit Trails**       | Log key generation (who, when, type)                        | Accountability & compliance      |
| **Key Records**        | Store ID, date, purpose, lifespan                           | Supports lifecycle management    |

## 📝 1.5 Key Registration

Before using a key, it must be **registered and tracked**.

| Step                | Purpose                                       |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Assign Key ID     | Track the key in systems (e.g., KMS, HSM)     |
| 👤 Define Ownership | Who can access or manage it                   |
| 🏷 Add Metadata     | Algorithm, usage (sign, encrypt), policy link |
| 📜 Apply Policies   | Rotation, expiry, revocation rules            |

---

## ⚙️ 2. OPERATIONAL (Use & Maintain)

### 🔐 2.1 Key Storage & Backup

| Method              | Description                                            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **HSM**             | Hardware-based storage – keys never leave in plaintext |
| **TPM**             | Embedded chip tied to device integrity                 |
| **Encrypted Vault** | Software-based, protected by KEK (Key Encryption Key)  |

**Backup Tips:**

* Store in separate locations (geo-redundant)
* Encrypt backups separately
* Require role-based access + MFA
* Monitor for tampering or corruption

---

### 🚛 2.2 Key Distribution

| Method                  | Best Practice                                |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Manual**              | Encrypt with KEK or split (secret sharing)   |
| **Automated**           | Use KMS or PKI (public key) for provisioning |
| **Key Wrapping**        | Use AES key wrap for secure transport        |
| **Secure Channels**     | TLS 1.3, IPsec, SSH                          |
| **Certificate Pinning** | Avoid fake CA attacks                        |
| **Zero Trust**          | Always authenticate, limit permissions       |

---

### 🔐 2.3 Key Usage

* **What:** Encrypt, decrypt, sign, verify, MAC
* **Who:** Only authorized roles
* **Logs:** Record every key operation (who, what, when)
* **TPM Sealing:** Keys tied to specific hardware
* **Side-Channel Protection:** Use hardened libraries (constant-time execution)

---

### 🔄 2.4 Key Rotation

* Set expiration/cryptoperiod
* Generate new → retire old
* Enable forward secrecy (new keys can't decrypt old data)
* Use dual-key systems during migration
* Automate alerts and rotation via KMS

---

## 🛑 3. POST-OPERATIONAL (Expire & Archive)

### 🔕 3.1 Key Deactivation

* Mark keys inactive after expiry or retirement
* Use a grace period to transition to new keys
* Map all dependencies before disabling

---

### ❌ 3.2 Key Revocation

* Use **CRL** or **OCSP** to signal compromised keys
* Trigger revocation during incidents
* Don’t skip – revoked keys still in use = attack risk

---

### 📦 3.3 Archival

* Store retired keys offline + encrypted
* Apply legal/business retention policies
* Require MFA or quorum (2-of-3) for access
* Reactivate only under strict controls

---

## 🔥 4. END-OF-LIFE (Destroy)

### 🧨 4.1 Destruction

* Securely delete (zeroize, crypto-shred) all copies
* Use dual authorization for critical keys
* Log destruction actions for compliance
* Follow NIST SP 800-88 or ISO/IEC 27040

---

### 📜 4.2 Compliance

* Follow **GDPR**, **HIPAA**, **PCI DSS**
* Keep audit logs to prove deletion
* Respect data residency for international keys

---

## 🔁 Quorum (M-of-N Control)

Use **quorum access** (e.g., 2 of 3 admins) for:

* Archiving or retrieving sensitive keys
* Export/import of master keys
* Final destruction

**Why:** Prevent a single person from misusing or deleting sensitive keys.

---

## 🧭 Summary: Secure Key Management Flow

```plaintext
1. Collect entropy → 2. Generate key → 3. Register → 4. Store securely →
5. Distribute safely → 6. Use with control → 7. Rotate → 8. Deactivate →
9. Archive or Destroy → 10. Maintain audit & compliance
```
